# Introduction

The purpose of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict dog breeds. I created a pipeline that can be used in a web or mobile app to process real images taken by users. Based on a picture of a dog, the algorithm I created can make an assessment about the dog breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.




If a dog is recognised in the image supplied, the algorithm returns the corresponding breed:

If a human is recognised in the image provided, the algorithm returns the resembling dog breed:
