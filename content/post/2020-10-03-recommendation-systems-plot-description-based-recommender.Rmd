# 1 Introduction


After having developed a simple ["Knowledge-based Recommender"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/10/01/recommendation-systems-knowledged-based-recommender/) we now come to another recommender: the Plot Description-based Recommender.


For this post the dataset *movies_metadata* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. You can download it from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets/Recommendation%20Systems/Plot%20Description-based%20Recommender).



# 2 Import the libraries and the data

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

import preprocessing_recommender_systems as prs
```


We are going to use the same dataframe as in the previous post.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = pd.read_csv('movies_metadata.csv')
df.head()
```

Some pre-processing steps are similar to those of the ["Knowledge-based Recommender"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/10/01/recommendation-systems-knowledged-based-recommender/).
Since I don't want to list them one by one again I have written them into a separate python file (preprocessing_recommender_systems.py).
This file is also stored on my ["GitHub Account"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets/Recommendation%20Systems/Plot%20Description-based%20Recommender) and can be downloaded from there. 


# 3 Data pre-processing Part I

The process steps can be traced individually in Post ["Knowledge-based Recommender"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/10/01/recommendation-systems-knowledged-based-recommender/) up to and including Chapter 3.2.
The only difference is that we additionally keep the columns 'overview' and 'id'. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = prs.clean_data(df)
df
```

# 4 Data pre-processing Part II

The recommendation model I want to develop will be based on the pairwise similarity between bodies of text.

# 4.1 Introduction of the CountVectorizer


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

```

# 4.2 Introduction of the TF-IDFVectorizer


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

```
