# 1 Introduction

In my post [CNN with Transfer Learning for Multi-Label Classification](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/01/19/cv-cnn-with-transfer-learning-for-multi-label-classification/) I showed how to train a Multi-Label image classifier with the help of a pre-trained neural network. Now I would like to improve this model by means of Fine Tuning.

I will again use the pre-trained network [VGG19](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/#vgg19-function) from the [Keras applications](https://keras.io/api/applications/) provided.

For this publication I used the images from the *Animal Faces* dataset from the statistics platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/animal-faces). You can download the used data from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/Computer%20Vision/CNN%20for%20Multi%20Label%20Classification).
