<p>The next unsupervised machine learning cluster algorithms is the Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise (DBSCAN).
DBSCAN is a density-based clusering algorithm, which can be used to identify clusters of any shape in a data set containing noise and outliers.</p>

<p>The basic idea behind DBSCAN is derived from a human intuitive clustering method.</p>
<p>If you have a look at the picture below you can easily identify 2 clusters along with several points of noise, because of the differences in the density of points.</p>
<p>Clusters are dense regions in the data space, separated by regions of lower density of points. The Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise algorithm is based on this intuitive notion of “clusters” and “noise”. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points.</p>
