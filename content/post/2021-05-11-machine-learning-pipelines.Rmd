# 1 Introduction


![](/post/2021-05-11-machine-learning-pipelines_files/p121s1.png)


Some time ago I had written the post [The Data Science Process (CRISP-DM)](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/08/21/the-data-science-process-crisp-dm/), which was about the correct development of Machine Learning algorithms. As you have seen here, this is quite a time-consuming matter if done correctly.

In order to quickly check which algorithm fits the data best, it is recommended to use machine learning pipelines. Once you have found a promising algorithm, you can start fine tuning with it and go through the process as described [here](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/08/21/the-data-science-process-crisp-dm/#data-science-best-practice-guidlines-for-ml-model-development).  



For this post the dataset *bird* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. You can download it from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets).



# 2 Loading the libraries


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

```



# 3 Loading the data




Description of predictors:
