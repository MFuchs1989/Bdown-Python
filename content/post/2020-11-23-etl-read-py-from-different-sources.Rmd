+ 2 The Setup



# 1 Introduction

Looking back, we have already covered an incredible number of data science topics.

We have dealt with a wide range of ["topics in the field of machine learning"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/08/20/roadmap-for-the-machine-learning-fields/).
And furthermore, how these algorithms can be applied in practice. 
A rule of thumb says that a data scientist spends 80% of his time on data preparation. The same amount of code is generated at this point. 
If you are working on a customer project that is only interested in the results, the notebook in which you are working, for example, is quickly overcrowded with syntax that only refers to the preparation of the data. 
For such a case it is a good idea to write an ETL-script.
ETL stands for extract, transform and load. 
In python you have the possibility (I prefer Microsoft Visual Studio) to create a python file (.py). 
In this post I want to introduce how to call such python files from different sources and get their different functions. 
In the following publications I will present different types of ETL variations.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

```
