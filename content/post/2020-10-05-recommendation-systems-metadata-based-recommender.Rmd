+ ["credits dataframe"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ReopPjfDglnCiKeJs_TfnMP0T5wM36zx/view?usp=sharing)





As in the ["Plot Description-based Recommender"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/10/03/recommendation-systems-plot-description-based-recommender/) post I will execute the first pre-processing steps for the main dataset using my stored function in the preprocessing_recommender_systems.py file.
This file is also stored on my ["GitHub Account"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets/Recommendation%20Systems/Metadata-based%20Recommender) and can be downloaded from there.
