<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>If you want to work with Python you need a suitable IDE.</p>
<p>IDE stands for “Integrated Development Environment” and there are many different ones you can use for Python:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eric-ide.python-projects.org/">Eric Python IDE</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/">PyCharm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>to name just a few.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>.
For this we need <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>.
Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the programming languages Python and R for scientific computing (among others: data science, machine learning).</p>
<p>Using Anaconda in conjunction with Jupyter Notebooks offers two distinct advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Jupyter Notebooks, you can create and share documents that include live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.</li>
<li>Using Anaconda, you can easily and quickly create virtual environments, extend them as desired and share them with other colleagues or clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post I want to show how to get <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> running.</p>

<div id="install-anaconda" class="section level1">
<h1>2 Install Anaconda</h1>
<p>First of all we have to install Anaconda. You can do this from here: <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">Anaconda Installation</a>.</p>
<p>Here you can select for which operating system you want to have Anaconda installed. For Windows for example follow this link: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows">Anaconda Installation for Windows</a>.</p>
<p>After the .exe file has been downloaded, run it and click through the installation.
There is only one step to pay attention to here. When you get to the Advanced Options section, select <strong>‘Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable’</strong>.
Otherwise we would have to add this path manually later.</p>
