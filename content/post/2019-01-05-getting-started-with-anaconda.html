<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>If you want to work with Python you need a suitable IDE.</p>
<p>IDE stands for “Integrated Development Environment” and there are many different ones you can use for Python:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://eric-ide.python-projects.org/">Eric Python IDE</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.spyder-ide.org/">Spyder</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/pycharm/">PyCharm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></li>
</ul>
<p>to name just a few.</p>
<p>I personally prefer to use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>.
For this we need <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>.
Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of the programming languages Python and R for scientific computing (among others: data science, machine learning).</p>
<p>Using Anaconda in conjunction with Jupyter Notebooks offers two distinct advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Jupyter Notebooks, you can create and share documents that include live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.</li>
<li>Using Anaconda, you can easily and quickly create virtual environments, extend them as desired and share them with other colleagues or clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post I want to show how to get <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a> and <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a> running.</p>
</div>
<div id="install-anaconda" class="section level1">
<h1>2 Install Anaconda</h1>
<p>First of all we have to install Anaconda. You can do this from here: <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">Anaconda Installation</a>.</p>
<p>Here you can select for which operating system you want to have Anaconda installed. For Windows for example follow this link: <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#windows">Anaconda Installation for Windows</a>.</p>
<p>After the .exe file has been downloaded, run it and click through the installation.
There is only one step to pay attention to here. When you get to the Advanced Options section, select <strong>‘Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environment variable’</strong>.
Otherwise we would have to add this path manually later.</p>

<div id="anaconda-navigator" class="section level1">
<h1>3 Anaconda Navigator</h1>
<p>After successful installation, search for Anaconda Navigator on your computer.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-01-05-getting-started-with-anaconda_files/p102p2.png" /></p>
<p>As we can see, different IDEs have already been installed with it, including Jupyter Notebooks. On the left side we can now select Environments.</p>
<div id="what-are-environments" class="section level2">
<h2>3.1 What are environments?</h2>
<p>To program with Python we need different libraries (for example numpy or pandas). We can store these collected in virtual environments. It is of great advantage that you can also use specific versions of the libraries.</p>
<p>To program with Python we need different libraries (for example numpy or pandas). We can store these collected in virtual environments. It is of great advantage that you can also use specific versions of the libraries. Why is this important, especially in project work, when you have developed models or done analyses for customers? You have the option of extracting all the libraries used for this purpose with their respective version and handing them over to the customer. In this way, the customer is able to execute the code without errors for a long time. It often happens that parts of packages change and then no longer work. That’s why version management is so incredibly beneficial.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-a-new-environment" class="section level2">
<h2>3.2 Create a new Environment</h2>
<p>We have now selected Environments on the left side.
At the bottom there is a button ‘Create’ with which you can create a new environment.<br />
Give it a desired name and select the Python or R programming language.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-01-05-getting-started-with-anaconda_files/p102p3.png" /></p>
<p>Click on your new environment and select ‘Not installed’ at the top.</p>
<p>Now you can search for new libraries that you have not yet installed in the respective environment. Here for example Pandas.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-01-05-getting-started-with-anaconda_files/p102p4.png" /></p>
<p>At the bottom you can press ‘apply’ to perform the installation. Often it happens that with large libraries like pandas is one, further packages are installed with it.</p>
</div>
<div id="import-environments" class="section level2">
<h2>3.3 Import Environments</h2>
<p>We do not need to load each library individually. Predefined environments with a list of libraries can also be imported at once. I have created a test environment here: environment.yml</p>
<p>Let’s use the Anaconda navigator and go to the environments via the corresponding button on the left.</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-01-05-getting-started-with-anaconda_files/p102p5.png" /></p>
<p>At the bottom there is a button called ‘Import’. With it we can import the new environment together with its predefined libraries.</p>
