# 1 Introduction

Now we come to another sub-area regarding text pre-processing: The removal of individual characters.

For this publication the processed dataset *Amazon Unlocked Mobile* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used as well as the created Example String. You can download both files from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20IV%20(Single%20Character%20Removal)).

# 3 Definition of required Functions

All functions are summarized here. I will show them again where they are used during this post if they are new and have not been explained yet.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
def word_count_func(text):
    '''
    Counts words within a string
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the function is to be applied, string
    
    Returns:
        Number of words within a string, integer
    ''' 
    return len(text.split())
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
def remove_single_char_func(text, threshold=1):
    '''
    Removes single characters from string, if present
    
    Step 1: Use word_tokenize() to get tokens from string
    Step 2: Removes words whose length falls below the threshold (by default = 1)
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the functions are to be applied, string
    
    Returns:
        String with removed words whose length was below the threshold (by default = 1)
    ''' 
    threshold = threshold
    
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    text = ' '.join([word for word in words if len(word) > threshold])
    return text
```


# 4 Text Pre-Processing

## 4.1 (Text Cleaning)

I have already described this part in an earlier post. See here: [Text Cleaning](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/22/nlp-text-pre-processing-i-text-cleaning/#text-cleaning)

## 4.2 (Tokenization)

I have already described this part in an earlier post. See here: [Text Pre-Processing II-Tokenization](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/25/nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words/#tokenization)


## 4.3  (Stop Words)

I have already described this part in an earlier post. See here: [Text Pre-Processing II-Stop Words](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/25/nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words/#stop-words)



## 4.4 (Digression: POS & NER)

I have already described this part in the previous post. See here: [Text Pre-Processing III-POS & NER](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/31/nlp-text-pre-processing-iii-pos-ner-and-normalization/#digression-pos-ner)


## 4.5  (Normalization)

I have already described this part in the previous post. See here: [Text Pre-Processing III-Normalization](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/31/nlp-text-pre-processing-iii-pos-ner-and-normalization/#normalization)
