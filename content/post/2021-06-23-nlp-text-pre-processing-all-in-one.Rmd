# 1 Introduction


I have focused heavily on the topic of Text Pre-Processing in my past publications. At this point, I would like to summarize all the important steps in one post. 
Here I will not go into the theoretical background. For that, please read my earlier posts, where I explained in detail what I did and why. 


For this publication the dataset *Amazon Unlocked Mobile* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. You can download it from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One).



# 2 Import the Libraries and the Data

As you have seen in my past posts, I have written some useful functions for text pre-processing.
Since my notebook would look pretty cluttered if I listed all the functions here, I created a [separate .py file](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/blob/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One/text_pre_processing.py) that contains all the featured functions. Feel free to download it from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One). 

Below I will call some of these functions from the [.py file](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/blob/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One/text_pre_processing.py) and use them in this post.

df = df[['Rating', 'Reviews']]
df['Reviews'] = df['Reviews'].astype(str)
df.head()
```
