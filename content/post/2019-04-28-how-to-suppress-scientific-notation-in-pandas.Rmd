# 1 Introduction

Scientific notations isn't helpful when you are trying to make quick comparisons across your dataset. 
However, Pandas will introduce scientific notations by default when the data type is a float. In this post I want to show how to get around this problem.


# 2 Scientific notations


Scientific notation (numbers with e) is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a clear way. 
Unfortunately for many people these are not very tangible.
Here are two examples of how to convert the scientifically written numbers into more readable ones.


$$ 2.553e8 = 2.553 \cdot 10^{8} = 255,300,000 $$

$$ 3.328e-5 = 3.328 \cdot 10^{-5} = 0.03328 $$

Now we know how to convert these numbers. But to do this every time with a calculator or something similar is very complicated. Fortunately there are a few methods to do this automatically. 


# 3 Import the libraries


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```


Here are a few more examples of how differently pandas floats are output. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
n_1 = 0.0007
n_1
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
n_2 = 0.0000035
n_2
```

n_3
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
n_ensemble = (n_1, n_2, n_3)
n_ensemble
```
