# 1 Introduction

Scientific notations isn't helpful when you are trying to make quick comparisons across your dataset. 
However, Pandas will introduce scientific notations by default when the data type is a float. In this post I want to show how to get around this problem.




# 2 Scientific notations


Scientific notation (numbers with e) is a way of writing very large or very small numbers in a clear way. 
Unfortunately for many people these are not very tangible.
Here are two examples of how to convert the scientifically written numbers into more readable ones.


$$ 2.553e8 = 2.553 \cdot 10^{8} = 255,300,000 $$

$$ 3.328e-5 = 2.553 \cdot 10^{8} = 255,300,000 $$




```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

```
