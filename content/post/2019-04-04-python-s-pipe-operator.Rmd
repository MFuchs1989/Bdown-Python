# 1 Introduction


Anyone who has ever worked with R probably knows the very useful pipe operator *%>%*.
Python also has a similar one that will be presented in different versions below.


For this post the dataset *flight* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. You can download it from my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets).



**Loading the libraries and the data**

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
flight = pd.read_csv("path/to/file/flight.csv")
```



# 2 Python's Pipe - Operator like R's %>%


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = (
    flight
    [['DayOfWeek', 'UniqueCarrier', 'Origin_Airport']]
)

df.head()
```

## 2.1 Filter and select

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = (
    flight
    [flight.DayOfWeek > 3]
    [['DayOfWeek', 'UniqueCarrier', 'Origin_Airport']]
)

df.head()
```

## 2.2 Multiple filter and select

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = (
    flight
    [(flight.DayOfWeek > 3) & (flight.Origin_Airport == 'JFK')]
    [['DayOfWeek', 'UniqueCarrier', 'Origin_Airport']]
)

df.head()
```

## 2.3 Sample and sort

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
(
    flight
    .sample(n=3)
    .sort_values('DayOfWeek')
    [['DayOfWeek', 'UniqueCarrier', 'Origin_Airport']]
)
```

## 2.4 Multiple group by and summarize

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = (               
    flight
    .groupby(['Origin_Airport', 'DayOfWeek'])
    .agg({'Scheduled_Departure': 'mean'})                                   
    # agg = summarize
    .rename(columns={"Scheduled_Departure": "avg_Scheduled_Departure"})     
    # due to agg we have to rename
    .reset_index()                                                          
    # agg returns a MultiIndex therefore reset_index()
    .round({'avg_Scheduled_Departure': 2})
)

df.head(12)
```

## 2.5 Group by and multiple summarize


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = (               
    flight
    .groupby(['Origin_Airport'])
    .agg({'Scheduled_Departure': 'mean', 
          'Dep_Delay': 'mean',
          'Scheduled_Arrival': 'mean',
          'Arrival_Delay': 'mean'})                                   
    .rename(columns={"Scheduled_Departure": "avg_Scheduled_Departure",
                    "Dep_Delay": "avg_Dep_Delay",
                    "Scheduled_Arrival": "avg_Scheduled_Arriva",
                    "Arrival_Delay": "avg_Arrival_Delay"})    
    .reset_index()
    .round({'avg_Scheduled_Departure': 2, 
            'avg_Dep_Delay': 2,
            'avg_Scheduled_Arriva': 2,
            'avg_Arrival_Delay':2})
)

df.head(12)
```

# 3 Conclusion

In my opinion, the Pipe Operator is a very useful feature which can be used in a variety of ways.
