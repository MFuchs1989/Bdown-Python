<p>Let’s now move on to another large but very interesting topic area from the field of Data Science: Natural Language Processing</p>
<div id="what-is-nlp" class="section level2">
<h2>1.1 What is NLP?</h2>
<p><a href="https://becominghuman.ai/a-simple-introduction-to-natural-language-processing-ea66a1747b32">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</a>, is a branch of artificial intelligence and generally defined as the automatic manipulation of natural language, such as speech and text, by software. Natural Language Processing interfaces with many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics, to bridge the gap between human communication and computer understanding.</p>
<p>NLP is not a new science in this sense and has been around for a very long time. In recent years, the need for and interest in human-machine communication has increased dramatically, so that with the availability of big data and increasingly powerful computers, the technology for NLP has also developed rapidly and is now accessible to a wide range of interested parties.</p>

<div id="future-perspectives-for-nlp" class="section level2">
<h2>1.2 Future Perspectives for NLP</h2>
<p>The global Natural Language Processing (NLP) market size is expected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/natural-language-processing-nlp-825.html">USD 11.6 billion in 2020 to USD 35.1 billion by 2026</a>, according to statistics from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/">MarketsandMarkets</a>. The increasing adoption of NLP-based applications in various industries is expected to provide tremendous opportunities for NLP providers.</p>

<h2>1.3 Application Areas of NLP</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at <a href="https://monkeylearn.com/blog/natural-language-processing-applications/">11 of the most interesting applications</a> of natural language processing in business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sentiment Analysis</li>
<li>Text Classification</li>
<li>Chatbots &amp; Virtual Assistants</li>
<li>Text Extraction</li>
<li>Machine Translation</li>
<li>Text Summarization</li>
<li>Market Intelligence</li>
<li>Auto-Correct</li>
<li>Intent Classification</li>
<li>Urgency Detection</li>
<li>Speech Recognition</li>
</ul>
<p>I will start here with the basics and then from post to post cover more and deeper topics as described above.</p>
