#1 Introduction


We have seen how to train and use different types of machine learning models. But how do we proceed when we have developed and trained a model with the desired performance? 
Due to the fact that the training of large machine learning models can sometimes take many hours, it is a good tip to save your trained models regularly so that you can access them later.

For this post the dataset *Iris* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/data) was used. A copy of the record is available at <https://drive.google.com/open?id=13KXvBAEKx_IYRX3iCYPnLtO9S9-a6JTS>.




#2 Loading the libraries and the data

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC


import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

#with joblib we'll safe our trained model
import joblib
```




```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
iris = pd.read_csv("Iris_Data.csv")
iris = iris[['sepal_length', 'sepal_width', 'species']]

iris
```
