<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>I have focused heavily on the topic of Text Pre-Processing in my past publications. At this point, I would like to summarize all the important steps in one post.
Here I will not go into the theoretical background. For that, please read my earlier posts, where I explained in detail what I did and why.</p>
<p>For this publication the dataset <em>Amazon Unlocked Mobile</em> from the statistic platform <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">“Kaggle”</a> was used. You can download it from my <a href="https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One">“GitHub Repository”</a>.</p>
