# 1 Introduction

After having reported very detailed in numerous posts about the different machine learning areas I will now work on various analytics fields. 

I start with Marketing Analytics.

To be precise, the analysis of conversion rates, their influencing factors and how machine learning algorithms can be used to generate valuable insights from this kind of data.


In this post I will use the data set 'bank-additional-full' and 'WA_Fn-UseC_-Marketing-Customer-Value-Analysis'. 
Both are from the website ["UCI Machine Learning Repository"](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).
You can also download them from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets).
