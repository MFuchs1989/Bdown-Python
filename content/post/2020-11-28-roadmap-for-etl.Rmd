# 1 Introduction


In the last articles I have intensely dealt with the topic ETL. 

An introduction to this topic is worthwhile for the following reasons:

+ Modularity - better coding
+ Flexibility
+ Easier for other data scientists to read the code
+ Easier error avoidance
+ Automation
+ ...



# 2 Roadmap for ETL

At the beginning of the series of lectures I showed basically how to call .py files, which are located in different directories, in a notebook. 

You can find this post her:

+ ["ETL - Read .py from different sources"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/23/etl-read-py-from-different-sources/)

Furthermore I have designed the following variants of pipelines. Each can be developed further as desired. 

# 2.1 ["Simple Pipeline"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/24/etl-simple-pipeline/)

# 3 Conclusion

The object-oriented programming used in the creation of ETLs is extremely helpful in everyday coding. I therefore advise everyone to learn this kind of programming!
