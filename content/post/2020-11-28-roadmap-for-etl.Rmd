# 1 Introduction


In the last articles I have intensely dealt with the topic ETL. 

An introduction to this topic is worthwhile for the following reasons:

+ Modularity - better coding
+ Flexibility
+ Easier for other data scientists to read the code
+ Easier error avoidance
+ Automation
+ ...



# 2 Roadmap for ETL

At the beginning of the series of lectures I showed basically how to call .py files, which are located in different directories, in a notebook. 

You can find this post her:

+ ["ETL - Read .py from different sources"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/23/etl-read-py-from-different-sources/)

Furthermore I have designed the following variants of pipelines. Each can be developed further as desired. 
Here is the corresponding legend in advance:

## 2.1 ["Simple Pipeline"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/24/etl-simple-pipeline/)

You can get the corresponding python script here: ["GitHub-Michael_Fuchs_Simple Pipeline"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/ETL/Simple%20Pipeline)

## 2.2 ["Pipeline with join"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/25/etl-pipeline-with-join/)

You can get the corresponding python script here: ["GitHub-Michael_Fuchs_Pipeline with join"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/ETL/Pipeline%20with%20join)

## 2.3 ["Pipeline with join2"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/26/etl-pipeline-with-join2/)

## 2.4 ["Pipeline with intermediate storage"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/27/etl-pipeline-with-intermediate-storage/)

# 3 Conclusion

The object-oriented programming used in the creation of ETLs is extremely helpful in everyday coding. I therefore advise everyone to learn this kind of programming!
