<h1>1 Introduction</h1>
<p>After having reported very detailed in numerous posts about the different machine learning areas I will now work on various analytics fields.</p>
<p>I start with Marketing Analytics.</p>
<p>To be precise, the analysis of conversion rates, their influencing factors and how machine learning algorithms can be used to generate valuable insights from this kind of data.</p>
<p>In this post I will use the data set ‘bank-additional-full’ and ‘WA_Fn-UseC_-Marketing-Customer-Value-Analysis’.
Both are from the website <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing">“UCI Machine Learning Repository”</a>.
You can also download them from my <a href="https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets">“GitHub Repository”</a>.</p>
