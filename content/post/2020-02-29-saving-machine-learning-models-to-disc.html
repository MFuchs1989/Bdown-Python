<p>#1 Introduction</p>
<p>We have seen how to train and use different types of machine learning models. But how do we proceed when we have developed and trained a model with the desired performance?
Due to the fact that the training of large machine learning models can sometimes take many hours, it is a good tip to save your trained models regularly so that you can access them later.</p>
<p>For this post the dataset <em>Iris</em> from the statistic platform <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/data">“Kaggle”</a> was used. A copy of the record is available at <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=13KXvBAEKx_IYRX3iCYPnLtO9S9-a6JTS" class="uri">https://drive.google.com/open?id=13KXvBAEKx_IYRX3iCYPnLtO9S9-a6JTS</a>.</p>
