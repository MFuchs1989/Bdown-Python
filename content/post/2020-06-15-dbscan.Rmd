# 1 Introduction

The next unsupervised machine learning cluster algorithms is the Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise (DBSCAN).
DBSCAN is a density-based clusering algorithm, which can be used to identify clusters of any shape in a data set containing noise and outliers.

The basic idea behind DBSCAN is derived from a human intuitive clustering method. 

If you have a look at the picture below you can easily identify 2 clusters along with several points of noise, because of the differences in the density of points.

Clusters are dense regions in the data space, separated by regions of lower density of points. The Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise algorithm is based on this intuitive notion of “clusters” and “noise”. The key idea is that for each point of a cluster, the neighborhood of a given radius has to contain at least a minimum number of points.
