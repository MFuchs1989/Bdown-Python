# Introduction

New year new topic!

I would like to start the new year 2021 with a topic that I have been working on for a while but have not yet found the time to write a post about it: **Computer Vision** !

In a nutshell:

Computer vision attempts to process and analyze images captured by cameras in a variety of ways to understand their content or extract geometric information.

We will come to the topic of how to build neural networks to solve computer vision problems. Before such a model training, a lot of preparatory work is needed, such as the collection and preparation of data or the handling of files.

Since I already had a lot to do with computer vision and it was too stupid for me to do the repetitive tasks manually, I automated some steps. And that's what this post is about.
