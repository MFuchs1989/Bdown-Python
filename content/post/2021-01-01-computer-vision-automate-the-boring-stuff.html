<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>New year new topic!</p>
<p>I would like to start the new year 2021 with a topic that I have been working on for a while but have not yet found the time to write a post about it: <strong>Computer Vision</strong> !</p>
<p>In a nutshell:</p>
<p>Computer vision attempts to process and analyze images captured by cameras in a variety of ways to understand their content or extract geometric information.</p>
<p>We will come to the topic of how to build neural networks to solve computer vision problems. Before such a model training, a lot of preparatory work is needed, such as the collection and preparation of data or the handling of files.</p>
<p>Since I already had a lot to do with computer vision and it was too stupid for me to do the repetitive tasks manually, I automated some steps. And thatâ€™s what this post is about.</p>
