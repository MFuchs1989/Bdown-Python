# 1 Introduction

In conclusion to all publications on dimension reduction methods, I am giving an overview of the algorithms discussed here.



# 2 Roadmap for Dimensionality Reduction

*Annotation:* The Kernel-PCA is of course not a linear dimension reduction method.



Here are the links to the individual topics.

# 3 Conclusion

Now we are finally at the end of the publications on the various topics in the field of data science. I will also give a graphic overview of the Machine Learning areas in a separate post.
