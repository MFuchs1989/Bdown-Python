# 1 Introduction

In my [last publication](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/22/nlp-text-pre-processing-i-text-cleaning/), I started the post series on the topic of text pre-processing. In it, I first covered all the possible applications of [Text Cleaning](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/22/nlp-text-pre-processing-i-text-cleaning/#text-cleaning). 

Now I will continue with the topics Tokenization and Stop Words. 


For this publication the processed dataset *Amazon Unlocked Mobile* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used as well as the created Example String. You can download both files from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20II%20(Tokenization%20and%20Stop%20Words)).

def word_count_func(text):
    '''
    Counts words within a string
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the function is to be applied, string
    
    Returns:
        Number of words within a string, integer

    Args:
        text (str): String to which the function is to be applied, string
    
    Returns:
        Clean string without Stop Words
    ''' 
    # check in lowercase 
    t = [token for token in text if token.lower() not in stopwords.words("english")]
    text = ' '.join(t)    
    return text
```


# 4 Text Pre-Processing

## 4.1 (Text Cleaning)

I have already described this part in the previous post. See here: [Text Cleaning](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/22/nlp-text-pre-processing-i-text-cleaning/#text-cleaning)


## 4.2 Tokenization

Tokenisation is a technique for breaking down a piece of text into small units, called tokens. A token may be a word, part of a word or just characters like punctuation.

Tokenisation can therefore be roughly divided into three groups:

+ Word Tokenization 
+ Character Tokenization and 
+ Partial Word Tokenization (n-gram characters)



In the following I will present two tokenizers:

+ Word Tokenizer
+ Sentence Tokenizer

Of course there are some more. Find the one on the [NLTK Homepage](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.tokenize.html#module-nltk.tokenize) which fits best to your data or to your problem solution.



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_for_tokenization = \
"Hi my name is Michael. \
I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist. \
Currently I am working on a post about NLP, more specifically about the Pre-Processing Steps."

text_for_tokenization
```

### 4.2.1 Word Tokenizer

To break a sentence into words, the word_tokenize() function can be used. Based on this, further text cleaning steps can be taken such as removing stop words or normalising text blocks. In addition, machine learning models need numerical data to be trained and make predictions. Again, tokenisation of words is a crucial part of converting text into numerical data.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
words = word_tokenize(text_for_tokenization)
print(words)
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p4.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Number of tokens found: ' + str(len(words)))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p5.png)


### 4.2.2 Sentence Tokenizer

Now the question arises, why do I actually need to tokenise sentences when I can tokenise individual words?

An example of use would be if you want to count the average number of words per sentence. How can I do that with the Word Tokenizer alone? I can't, I need both the sent_tokenize() function and the word_tokenize() function to calculate the ratio.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
sentences = sent_tokenize(text_for_tokenization)
print(sentences)
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p6.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Number of sentences found: ' + str(len(sentences)))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p7.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
for each_sentence in sentences:
    n_words=word_tokenize(each_sentence)
    print(each_sentence)   
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
for each_sentence in sentences:
    n_words=word_tokenize(each_sentence)
    print(len(n_words))
```

### 4.2.3 **Application** to the Example String

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
tokens_clean_text = word_tokenize(clean_text)
print(tokens_clean_text)
```

```

### 4.2.4 **Application** to the DataFrame


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df.head()
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p12.png)

Here I set a limit for the column width so that it remains clear. This setting should be reset at the end, otherwise it will remain. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', 30)
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df['Reviews_Tokenized'] = df['Clean_Reviews'].apply(word_tokenize)

df.head()
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p13.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df['Token_Count'] = df['Reviews_Tokenized'].str.len()

df.head()
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p14.png)

It is always worthwhile (I have made a habit of doing this) to have the number of remaining words or tokens displayed and also to store them in the data record. The advantage of this is that (especially in later process steps) it is very quick and easy to see what influence the operation has had on the quality of my information. Of course, this can only be done on a random basis, but it is easy to see whether the function applied had negative effects that were not intended. Or you look at a case difference if you don't know which type of algorithm (for example, in normalisation) fits my data better.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Average of words counted: ' + str(df['Word_Count'].mean()))
print('Average of tokens counted: ' + str(df['Token_Count'].mean()))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p15.png)

Ok interesting, the average number of words has increased slightly. Let's take a look at what caused that:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_subset = df[['Clean_Reviews', 'Word_Count', 'Reviews_Tokenized', 'Token_Count']]
df_subset['Diff'] = df_subset['Token_Count'] - df_subset['Word_Count']


df_subset = df_subset[(df_subset["Diff"] != 0)]
df_subset.sort_values(by='Diff', ascending=False)
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p16.png)

Note: In the following I do not take the first row from the sorted dataset, but from the created dataset df_subset.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_subset['Clean_Reviews'].iloc[0]
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p17.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_subset['Reviews_Tokenized'].iloc[0]
```

Here we see the reason: The tokenizer has turned 'cannot' into 'can not'. 


## 4.3  Stop Words

Stop words are frequently used words such as I, a, an, in etc. They do not contribute significantly to the information content of a sentence, so it is advisable to remove them by storing a list of words that we consider stop words. The library nltk has such lists for 16 different languages that we can refer to.

Here are the defined stop words for the English language:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print(stopwords.words("english"))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p19.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_for_stop_words = "Hi my name is Michael. I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist."
text_for_stop_words
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p20.png)

Stop Words can be removed well with the following function. However, the sentences must be converted into word tokens for this. I have explained in detail how to do this in the previous chapter. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
tokens_text_for_stop_words = word_tokenize(text_for_stop_words)
print(tokens_text_for_stop_words)
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p21.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
def remove_english_stopwords_func(text):
    '''
    Removes Stop Words (also capitalized) from a string, if present
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the function is to be applied, string
    
    Returns:
        Clean string without Stop Words
    ''' 
    # check in lowercase 
    t = [token for token in text if token.lower() not in stopwords.words("english")]
    text = ' '.join(t)    
    return text
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
remove_english_stopwords_func(tokens_text_for_stop_words)
```

### 4.3.1 **Application** to the Example String

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print(tokens_clean_text)
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p23.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Number of tokens found: ' + str(len(tokens_clean_text)))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p24.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
stop_words_within_tokens_clean_text = [w for w in tokens_clean_text if w in stopwords.words("english")]

print()
print('These Stop Words were found in our example string:')
print()
print(stop_words_within_tokens_clean_text)
print()
print('Number of Stop Words found: ' + str(len(stop_words_within_tokens_clean_text)))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p25.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
clean_text_wo_stop_words = [w for w in tokens_clean_text if w not in stopwords.words("english")]

print()
print('These words would remain after Stop Words removal:')
print()
print(clean_text_wo_stop_words)
print()
print('Number of remaining words: ' + str(len(clean_text_wo_stop_words)))
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p26.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
clean_text_wo_stop_words = remove_english_stopwords_func(tokens_clean_text)
clean_text_wo_stop_words
```

![](/post/2021-05-25-nlp-text-pre-processing-ii-tokenization-and-stop-words_files/p124p27.png)

Note: After removing the stop words we need the word_count function again for counting, because they are no tokens anymore.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Number of words: ' + str(word_count_func(clean_text_wo_stop_words)))
```

# 5 Conclusion

In this part of the Text Pre-Processing series, I explained how tokenization works, how to use it, and showed how to remove Stop Words. 

I save the edited DataFrame and Example String again for subsequent use. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
pk.dump(clean_text_wo_stop_words, open('clean_text_wo_stop_words.pkl', 'wb'))

df.to_csv('Amazon_Unlocked_Mobile_small_Part_II.csv', index = False)
```
