Data Scientists tend to make their tasks more and more effective and efficient. This also applies to the field of machine learning model training. 
There is a wide range of algorithms that can be used for regression and classification problems. 
[Machine Learning Pipelines]( https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/11/machine-learning-pipelines/) have helped to simplify and speed up the process of finding the best model. 

Now we come to the next stage: **Automated Machine Learning Libraries**

In my research, I came across [**PyCaret**](https://pycaret.org/) in this regard. 

[PyCaret is an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows.](https://pycaret.org/)

It can be used to work on the following problems:

+ [Classification](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#classification)
+ [Regression](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#regression)
+ [Clustering](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#clustering)
+ [Anomaly Detection](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#anomaly-detection)
+ [Natural Language Processing](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#natural-language-processing)
+ [Association Rules Mining](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#association-rules-mining)
+ [Time Series (beta)](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/quickstart#time-series-beta)


When I read through the [GitBook]( https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/) and the [API Reference]( https://pycaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) PyCaret was very promising and I can say I was not disappointed. 

In the following I will show how to create a classification algorithm with PyCaret and what other possibilities you have with this AutoML library.


# 2 Loading the Libraries and Data


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

import pycaret.classification as pycc
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
class Color:
   PURPLE = '\033[95m'
   CYAN = '\033[96m'
   DARKCYAN = '\033[36m'
   BLUE = '\033[94m'
   GREEN = '\033[92m'
   YELLOW = '\033[93m'
   RED = '\033[91m'
   BOLD = '\033[1m'
   UNDERLINE = '\033[4m'
   END = '\033[0m'
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
bird_df = pd.read_csv('bird.csv').drop('id', axis=1)
bird_df.head()
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
bird_df.isnull().sum()
```

# 3 PyCaret - Classification

## 3.1  Setup

As a first step, I initialize the training environment. At the same time, the transformation pipeline is created.
This setup function takes two parameters:

+ the dataset
+ the target variable


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
summary_preprocess = pycc.setup(bird_df, target = 'type')
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p3.png)

First we can check if the data types of all variables were recognized correctly. If this is the case, as here, we can press Enter.


![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p4.png)

Now we get a detailed overview (only a part of it is shown here) of the initialized setup and the performed transformation steps of the pipeline. 

Default Transformations:

+ Missing Value Imputation
+ Perfect Collinearity Removal
+ One-Hot Encoding
+ Train-Test Split
 

All transformations can be set individually in the setup function. See here: [PyCaret Official - Preprocessing](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/preprocessing)

These include:

+ [Data Preparation](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/preprocessing/data-preparation)
    + Missing Values
    + Data Types
    + Encoding
+ [Scale and Transform](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/preprocessing/scale-and-transform)
+ [Feature Engineering](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/preprocessing/feature-engineering)
+ [Feature Selection](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/preprocessing/feature-selection) and 
+ [Other Parameters](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/preprocessing/other-setup-parameters)


Use these preprocessing and transformation parameters in the setup as needed for your present data set. In my example I leave it at the default settings. 

Using the get_config function we can view the edited record. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
x = pycc.get_config('X')
y = pycc.get_config('y')
trainX = pycc.get_config('X_train')
testX = pycc.get_config('X_test')
trainY = pycc.get_config('y_train')
testY = pycc.get_config('y_test')
```


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
x
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p5.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
y
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p6.png)


Here we see how the target variable 'type' has been recoded to apply machine learning algorithms. This step can also be seen in the summary_preprocess in line 4 (index 3). 

If you want to get other values or information from the initiated setup here is a list of variables that can be retrieved using the get_config function: [Variables accessible by get_config function](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/others#get_config)



## 3.2  Compare Models

Now that all preprocessing steps are completed, we can check the performance of the classification algorithms available in PyCaret. 



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
available_models = pycc.models()
available_models
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p7.png)

Now let's compare these models:



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
best_clf = pycc.compare_models()
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p8.png)


Another nice thing about this view is that the best values of each metric are highlighted in yellow. The Extra Trees Classifier achieved the highest value for almost every metric, so all highlighted fields are listed under this algorithm.

Let's take a detailed look at the best model from the comparison:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print(best_clf)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p9.png)


**Changing the sort order**

Of course, the highest Accuracy is not always the decisive metric, so sorting can also be done according to other evaluation metrics. Here, for example, the syntax to sort by AUC score:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
best_clf_AUC = pycc.compare_models(sort = 'AUC')
```


### 3.2.1 Comparison of Specific Models

Since model training can take different amounts of time, depending on the size of the data set, it is sometimes advisable to compare only certain models.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
best_clf_specific = pycc.compare_models(include = ['ada', 'svm', 'nb'])
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p10.png)

**Exclusion of specific models:**

Alternatively, certain models can simply be excluded from the performance comparison. See the following syntax:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
best_clf_excl = pycc.compare_models(exclude = ['dummy', 'ridge'])
```




### 3.2.2 Further Settings

In PyCaret you have the possibility to make further settings in the model comparison. These are:

+ [Setting the Budget Time](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/train#set-the-budget-time)
+ [Setting the Probability Threshold](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/train#set-the-probability-threshold)
+ [Disable Cross-Validation](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/train#disable-cross-validation)

The syntax to these settings would look like this:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
best_clf_further_settings = pycc.compare_models(budget_time = 0.7, 
                                                probability_threshold = 0.75, 
                                                cross_validation=False)
```



## 3.3  Model Evaluation

Now that we have seen in our comparison (best_clf) that the Extra Trees Classifier has achieved the best values, I would like to go into the evaluation for this algorithm.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print(best_clf)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p11.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
evaluation_best_clf = pycc.evaluate_model(best_clf)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p12.png)


Since the evaluate_model function can only be used in notebooks, the plot_model function can also be used as an alternative. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
pycc.plot_model(best_clf, plot = 'auc')
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p13.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
pycc.plot_model(best_clf, plot = 'confusion_matrix')
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p14.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
pycc.plot_model(best_clf, 
                plot = 'confusion_matrix', 
                plot_kwargs = {'percent' : True})
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p15.png)


**Saving image files**

If you want to save the output graphics in PyCaret, you have to set the safe parameter to True. 
The syntax would look like this:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
pycc.plot_model(best_clf, 
                plot = 'confusion_matrix', 
                plot_kwargs = {'percent' : True},
                save = True)
```

Here is an overview of possible graphics in PyCaret: [Examples by module](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/analyze#examples-by-module)



## 3.4 Model Training

In comparing the classification algorithms, we saw that Extra Trees Classifier performed the best. 

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print(best_clf)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p16.png)


So we will do the model training with it as well. This is done in PyCaret with the create_model function, which also automatically includes cross-validation. Here I set the number of cross-validation runs to 5 (default = 10).

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf = pycc.create_model('et', fold = 5)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p17.png)


For some specific algorithms, the hyperparameters can be set specifically. Here is an example with the Decision Tree Classifier:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf_custom_param = pycc.create_model('et', 
                                        max_depth = 5)
```


**Further Settings**

As with model comparison, additional settings can be made during model training:

+ [Setting the Probability Threshold](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/train#set-the-probability-threshold)
+ [Disable Cross-Validation](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/train#disable-cross-validation)

The syntax to these settings would look like this:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf_further_settings = pycc.create_model('et', 
                                            probability_threshold = 0.75, 
                                            cross_validation=False)
```



**Access performance metrics grid**

The performance metrics are only displayed here, but not returned. 
However, they can be retrieved with the pull function.



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf_results = pycc.pull()
et_clf_results
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p18.png)


Filtered here according to the lines Mean and SD:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf_results.loc[['Mean', 'SD']]
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p19.png)


If you want to train multiple models or the same model with different configurations, you can do this with a for-loop. Have a look at this link: [Train models in a loop](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/get-started/functions/train#train-models-in-a-loop)



## 3.5  Model Optimization

There are several possibilities in PyCaret to further improve the performance of a model. I would like to present these in the following sections.


### 3.5.1 Tune the Model

If you want to tune the hyperparameters of the model, you have to use the tune_model function.

Since n_iter is set to 10 by default, I always like to increase this value as it improves the optimization. However, one must also mention here that the calculation time increases as a result.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf_tuned = pycc.tune_model(et_clf, n_iter = 50)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p20.png)

**Access performance metrics grid**

Again, the performance metrics are only displayed but not returned. 
Therefore we use the pull function again:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
et_clf_tuned_results = pycc.pull()
et_clf_tuned_results
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p21.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print(Color.BOLD +'Comparison of hyperparameters' + Color.END)
print()
print(Color.GREEN + Color.UNDERLINE + 'ExtraTreesClassifier:' + Color.END)
print()
print(et_clf)
print()
print(Color.RED + Color.UNDERLINE + 'ExtraTreesClassifier with Optimization:' + Color.END)
print()
print(et_clf_tuned)
```

![](/post/2022-01-01-automl-using-pycaret-classification_files/p133p22.png)

You can spend a lot of time optimizing ML algorithms, so there are also some parameters you can set in the tune_model function. These are among others: 

+ custom_grid
+ search_library
+ search_algorithm
+ early_stopping

You can read about the other parameters here: [pycaret.classification.tune_model()](https://pycaret.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/classification.html#pycaret.classification.tune_model)
