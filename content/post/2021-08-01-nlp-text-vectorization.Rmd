# 1 Introduction

Now that we have cleaned up and prepared our text dataset in the previous posts, we come to the next topic: **Text Vectorization**

Most machine learning algorithms cannot handle string variables. We have to convert them into a format that is readable for machine learning algorithms. Text vectorization is the mapping of vocabulary or tokens from a data set to a corresponding vector of real numbers. These vectors can be used as input to machine learning models. 

In the following, I will use a simple example to show several ways in which vectorization can be done. 

Finally, I will apply a vectorization method to the dataset (['Amazon_Unlocked_Mobile_small_pre_processed.csv'](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One)) created and processed in the [last post](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/06/23/nlp-text-pre-processing-all-in-one/) and train a machine learning model on it.
