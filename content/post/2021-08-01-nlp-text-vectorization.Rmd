# 1 Introduction

Now that we have cleaned up and prepared our text dataset in the previous posts, we come to the next topic: **Text Vectorization**

Most machine learning algorithms cannot handle string variables. We have to convert them into a format that is readable for machine learning algorithms. Text vectorization is the mapping of vocabulary or tokens from a data set to a corresponding vector of real numbers. These vectors can be used as input to machine learning models. 

In the following, I will use a simple example to show several ways in which vectorization can be done. 

Finally, I will apply a vectorization method to the dataset (['Amazon_Unlocked_Mobile_small_pre_processed.csv'](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20-%20All%20in%20One)) created and processed in the [last post](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/06/23/nlp-text-pre-processing-all-in-one/) and train a machine learning model on it. 


# 2 Import the Libraries and the Data


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC

from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df = pd.DataFrame({'Rating': [2,5,3],
                   'Text': ["This is a brown horse",
                            "This horse likes to play",
                            "The horse is in the stable"]})
df
```
