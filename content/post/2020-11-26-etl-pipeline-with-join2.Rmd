# 1 Introduction

Let us come to another variant of ETL. The ["last time"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/11/25/etl-pipeline-with-join/) I prepared two data sets and then merged them. 
Now I will again load two records, edit one of them to make a join possible, merge the records and edit them further.
Finally I want to save the final dataset.

**Overview of the ETL steps:**

At the end I will test the created ETL. I will show this from another jupyter notebook and a fully automatic call from the command line. 

For this post I use two specially created sample data sets. A copy of them is stored in my ["GitHub Repo"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets/ETL/Pipeline%20with%20join). 


# 2 Setup


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
