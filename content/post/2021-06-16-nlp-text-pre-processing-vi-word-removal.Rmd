# 1 Introduction

Let's move on to the final part of the post series on Pre-Processing Steps in NLP: Word Removal


For this publication the processed dataset *Amazon Unlocked Mobile* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. Furthermore I will use the last state of the example string and the saved frequency tables I created in my last post. You can download all files from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Datasets-and-Miscellaneous/tree/main/datasets/NLP/Text%20Pre-Processing%20VI%20(Word%20Removal)).

```

## 4.4 (Digression: POS & NER)

I have already described this part in an earlier post. See here: [Text Pre-Processing III-POS & NER](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/05/31/nlp-text-pre-processing-iii-pos-ner-and-normalization/#digression-pos-ner)


## 4.5  (Normalization)

## 4.8 Removing specific Words


Sometimes it is helpful or even necessary to specifically remove certain words.

In this and the two following chapters, I will refer to the frequency tables from the Text Exploration chapter and will always recall them so that it is clear to the reader to which processing stage of each text I am referring. All operations from this and the following two chapters will be performed on the example string 'clean_text_wo_single_char' and the column 'Reviews_cleaned_wo_single_char'. Furthermore, [at the end of this post](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/06/16/nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal/#final-words), I will again give an overview of which operations I applied to which source column and what happened in the process, so that there is no confusion for the reader.

But now let's take a look at this tongue twister as an example:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_for_word_removal = \
"Give papa a cup of proper coffe in a copper coffe cup."
text_for_word_removal
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p3.png)


### 4.8.1 Single Word Removal

The removal of individual words can be done with the help of this function:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
def single_word_remove_func(text, word_2_remove):
    '''
    Removes a specific word from string, if present
    
    Step 1: Use word_tokenize() to get tokens from string
    Step 2: Removes the defined word from the created tokens
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the functions are to be applied, string
        word_2_remove (str): Word to be removed from the text, string
    
    Returns:
        String with removed words
    '''    
    word_to_remove = word_2_remove
    
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    text = ' '.join([word for word in words if word != word_to_remove])
    return text
```



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
single_word_remove_func(text_for_word_removal, "coffe")
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p4.png)


### 4.8.2 Multiple Word Removal

But often you have the problem of having to remove several words. To use the function shown above each time would be tedious. Therefore, here is a function that can remove multiple words from a sentence:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
def multiple_word_remove_func(text, words_2_remove_list):
    '''
    Removes certain words from string, if present
    
    Step 1: Use word_tokenize() to get tokens from string
    Step 2: Removes the defined words from the created tokens
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the functions are to be applied, string
        words_2_remove_list (list): Words to be removed from the text, list of strings
    
    Returns:
        String with removed words
    '''     
    words_to_remove_list = words_2_remove_list
    
    words = word_tokenize(text)
    text = ' '.join([word for word in words if word not in words_to_remove_list])
    return text
```

The application of this function can be done in several ways. Below are three examples of how to do this:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
multiple_word_remove_func(text_for_word_removal, ["coffe", "cup"])
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p5.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
list_with_words = ["coffe", "cup"]

multiple_word_remove_func(text_for_word_removal, list_with_words)
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p6.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
params= [text_for_word_removal,
         ["coffe", "cup"]]

multiple_word_remove_func(*params)
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p7.png)


### 4.8.3 **Application** to the Example String

For this, let's look at our last state with the String example:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
clean_text_wo_single_char
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p8.png)

For this purpose, we also take a look at the frequency distribution of the words:


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
plt.figure(figsize=(11,7))
plt.bar(df_most_common_words['Word'], 
        df_most_common_words['Frequency'])

plt.xticks(rotation = 45)

plt.xlabel('Most common Words')
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Frequency distribution of the 25 most common words")

plt.show()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p9.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_most_common_words.head()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p10.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
plt.figure(figsize=(11,7))
plt.bar(df_least_common_words['Word'], 
        df_least_common_words['Frequency'])

plt.xticks(rotation = 45)

plt.xlabel('Least common Words')
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Frequency distribution of the 10 least common words")

plt.show()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p11.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_least_common_words.tail()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p12.png)


#### 4.8.3.1  with Single Word Removal


In the following I would like to remove the word 'special', because it appears too often in the example string.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
clean_text_wo_specific_word = single_word_remove_func(clean_text_wo_single_char, "special")
clean_text_wo_specific_word
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p13.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Number of words (bevore single word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(clean_text_wo_single_char)))
print('Number of words (after single word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(clean_text_wo_specific_word)))
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p14.png)

Worked wonderfully. Since the word 'special' appears 4 times, this difference can also be seen in the print statement shown above. 



#### 4.8.3.2  with Multiple Word Removal


Now, **in addition**, I would like to remove more words, which I think are not profitable. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
clean_text_wo_specific_words = multiple_word_remove_func(clean_text_wo_specific_word, 
                                                       ["expose", "currently", "character"])
clean_text_wo_specific_words
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p15.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
print('Number of words (bevore multiple word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(clean_text_wo_specific_word)))
print('Number of words (after multiple word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(clean_text_wo_specific_words)))
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p16.png)


This operation also worked the way we wanted it to. The three words we removed each appeared only once in the text. Hence the difference of 3. 



### 4.8.4 **Application** to the DataFrame

Here again we take a look at the frequency distribution of the words from the column 'Reviews_cleaned_wo_single_char'. This is the column I decided to work on in the [Removing Single Characters'](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/06/05/nlp-text-pre-processing-iv-single-character-removal/#application-to-the-dataframe) chapter.



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
plt.figure(figsize=(11,7))
plt.bar(df_most_common_words_text_corpus['Word'], 
        df_most_common_words_text_corpus['Frequency'])

plt.xticks(rotation = 45)

plt.xlabel('Most common Words')
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Frequency distribution of the 25 most common words")

plt.show()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p17.png)



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_most_common_words_text_corpus.head()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p18.png)


In the last chapter [Text Exploration](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/06/10/nlp-text-pre-processing-v-text-exploration/#divided-by-rating) I split this column again according to the evaluation type ('positive', 'neutral' and 'negative') and made separate visualizations of the word frequency for each. The result was that the word 'phone' occurs disproportionately often in all three sub-sets compared to the other words. I can therefore assume that this word is not particularly profitable for a later classification and would therefore like to remove it.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
plt.figure(figsize=(11,7))
plt.bar(df_least_common_words_text_corpus['Word'], 
        df_least_common_words_text_corpus['Frequency'])

plt.xticks(rotation = 45)

plt.xlabel('Least common Words')
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Frequency distribution of the 10 least common words")

plt.show()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p19.png)


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df_least_common_words_text_corpus.tail()
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p20.png)


#### 4.8.4.1  with Single Word Removal

In the following, I will now remove the word 'phone' from all rows in the 'Reviews_cleaned_wo_single_char' column. 



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df["Reviews_cleaned_wo_specific_word"] = df.apply(lambda x: single_word_remove_func(x["Reviews_cleaned_wo_single_char"], 
                                                            "phone"), axis = 1)
```


Calculating the number of words per line and saving it in a separate column as I have done in the past chapters is in my opinion not useful at this point.

To check that the word 'phone' has been deleted from all lines, it is useful to create a new text corpus and compare the number of words. I had already created the first text corpus in the last chapter, but for the sake of completeness I will do it again here.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_corpus_original = df['Reviews_cleaned_wo_single_char'].str.cat(sep=' ')
text_corpus_wo_specific_word = df['Reviews_cleaned_wo_specific_word'].str.cat(sep=' ')

print('Number of words (bevore single word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(text_corpus_original)))
print('Number of words (after single word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(text_corpus_wo_specific_word)))
print()
print('Diff: ' + str(word_count_func(text_corpus_original) - word_count_func(text_corpus_wo_specific_word)))
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p21.png)

The operation also worked well on the data set. If you compare the calculated difference with the word frequency table above (df_most_common_words_text_corpus), you can see that the word 'phone' has been completely removed from all lines. 


#### 4.8.4.2  with Multiple Word Removal

Also at this point I will now remove other words **from the newly generated** 'Reviews_cleaned_wo_specific_word' column that I feel are not profitable. To do this I will take the 3 words that are at the very end of the frequency table (df_least_common_words_text_corpus). 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
df["Reviews_cleaned_wo_specific_words"] = df.apply(lambda x: multiple_word_remove_func(x["Reviews_cleaned_wo_specific_word"], 
                                                         ["stabalize", "dazzle", "vague"]), axis = 1)
```


Now we compare the text corpuses with each other again.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_corpus_wo_specific_words = df['Reviews_cleaned_wo_specific_words'].str.cat(sep=' ')

print('Number of words (bevore multiple word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(text_corpus_wo_specific_word)))
print('Number of words (after multiple word removal): ' + str(word_count_func(text_corpus_wo_specific_words)))
print()
print('Diff: ' + str(word_count_func(text_corpus_wo_specific_word) - word_count_func(text_corpus_wo_specific_words)))
```

![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p22.png)

This result also suggests a positive implementation of the operation. If we add the frequency values of the last three words in the frequency table (df_least_common_words_text_corpus) above, we get the sum of 3, which is congruent with the difference shown above. 



## 4.9 Removing Frequent words

In the previously shown chapter, I showed how to remove certain words from a text corpus or from all rows in a column. However, it is often the case that you have far too many of them for me to want to name them individually in the single_word_remove function or the multiple_word_remove function.

For this reason I have written functions for this and the following chapter, which give me a list of common or rare words, which I can then remove from my text.

But be careful when removing such words. They can nevertheless (even if one would not suspect it at first) be profitable for the later algorithm. I therefore recommend to always save the new text modules in a separate column or object and to check later with the help of the validation of the algorithm whether the opearation was useful or not.


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_for_freq_word_removal = \
"Peter Pepper picked a pack of pickled peppers. How many pickled peppers did Peter Pepper pick?"
text_for_freq_word_removal
```

## 4.10 Removing Rare words


We will probably use this function more often, which allows us to identify rarely occurring words in a text and then remove them. 


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
text_for_rare_word_removal = \
"Sue sells seashells by the seashore. The seashells Sue sells are seashells Sue is sure."
text_for_rare_word_removal
```

    '''
    Returns the most rarely used words from a text

    Step 2: Uses the FreqDist function to determine the word frequency
    
    Args:
        text (str): String to which the functions are to be applied, string
    
    Returns:
        List of the most rarely occurring words (by default = 5)

# 5 Final Words


![](/post/2021-06-16-nlp-text-pre-processing-vi-word-removal_files/p128p47.png)

When removing certain words, I applied the operation to the previously created column. Otherwise, I always used our original column 'Reviews_cleaned_wo_single_char' as the basis for the functions.

What I didn't do in this post was generate a separate column where I removed both the frequented words and the rarely occurring words. My tip at this point would be to create different columns where you have removed different types and different number of words and then see which data base the algorithm performs best on.



# 6 Conclusion

Now I'm at the end of my post series on text pre-processing.
In this last section I have shown how to remove certain, highly frequent or rare words from text modules.
