# 1 Introduction


In my most recent publications, I have dealt extensively with individual topics in the field of regression analysis. This post should serve as a summary of the topics covered.



# 2 Roadmap for Regression Analysis

# 4 Further Regression Algorithms


**Still in development**





# 5 Conclusion

The methods mentioned in the listed posts show how to improve regression models.

The focus of the upcoming publications will be on algorithms for classification problems.
