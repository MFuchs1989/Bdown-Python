# 1 Introduction


In my most recent publications, I have dealt extensively with individual topics in the field of regression analysis. This post should serve as a summary of the topics covered.



# 2 Roadmap for Regression Analysis

# 5 Regression with Neural Networks

Of course, in addition to traditional regression algorithms, neural networks can be used to solve regression problems. 

Here again are the links to the respective publications: 

+ [Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPRegressor)](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2021/02/10/nn-multi-layer-perceptron-regressor-mlpregressor/)





# 6 Conclusion

The methods mentioned in the listed posts show how to improve regression models.

The focus of the upcoming publications will be on algorithms for classification problems.
