#1 Introduction


In my most recent publications, I have dealt extensively with individual topics in the field of regression analysis. This post should serve as a summary of the topics covered.



#2 Roadmap for Regression Analysis

Here are the links to the individual topics.


**Data pre-processing:**

+ ["Handling Missing Values"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/03/18/dealing-with-missing-values/)
+ ["Dealing with outliers"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/08/20/dealing-with-outliers/)
+ ["Feature Encoding"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/06/16/types-of-encoder/)
+ ["Feature Scaling"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/08/31/feature-scaling-with-scikit-learn/)


**Feature Selection:**

Filter methods:

+ ["Dealing with highly correlated features"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/07/28/dealing-with-highly-correlated-features/)
+ ["Dealing with constant features"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/08/09/dealing-with-constant-and-duplicate-features/)
+ ["Dealing with duplicate features"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/08/09/dealing-with-constant-and-duplicate-features/)
+ ["SelectKBest"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/09/27/wrapper-methods/)


Wrapper methods:

+ ["Forward Feature Selection"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/09/27/wrapper-methods/)
+ ["Backward Elimination"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/09/27/wrapper-methods/)
+ ["Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/09/27/wrapper-methods/)


Embedded methods:

+ ["Ridge"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/10/08/embedded-methods/)

+ ["Elastic Net"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/10/08/embedded-methods/)




#3 Conclusion

The methods mentioned in the listed posts show how to improve regression models.

The focus of the upcoming publications will be on algorithms for classification problems.
