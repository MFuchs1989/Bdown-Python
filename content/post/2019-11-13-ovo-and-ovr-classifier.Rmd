#1 Introduction

We already know from my previous posts how to train a binary classifier using ["Logistic Regression"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/10/31/introduction-to-logistic-regression/) or ["Support Vector Machines"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/11/08/introduction-to-support-vector-machines/).


For this post the dataset *MNIST* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/data) was used. A copy of the record is available at <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bfquk0uKnh6B3Yjh2N87qh0QcmLokrVk>.
