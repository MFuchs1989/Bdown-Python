# 1 Introduction

After Marketing Analytics it is now time to dedicate yourself to a new field of Analytics. 
As we have already touched on ["recommendations in the marketing context"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/09/08/marketing-product-analytics-and-recommendations/), it makes sense to continue with the topic of recommendation systems at this point. 

We will start with a very simple recommender: The **Knowledged-based Recommender**


For this post the dataset ** from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. You can download it from my ["GitHub Repository"](https://github.com/MFuchs1989/Bdown-Python/tree/master/datasets).
