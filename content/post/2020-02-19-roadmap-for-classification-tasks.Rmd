# 1 Introduction

test

Another big chapter from the supervised machine learning area comes to an end. In the past 4 months I wrote in detail about the functionality and use of the most common classification algorithms within data science.

Analogous to my post ["Roadmap for Regression Analysis"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/10/14/roadmap-for-regression-analysis/), I will give again an overview of the handling of classification tasks.

**Notes on the special classifiers:**

As described in the [SGD Classifier](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/11/11/introduction-to-sgd-classifier/) post, this is not a classifier. It's a linear classifier optimized by the Stochastic Gradient Descent.


With the [One-vs-One and One-vs-Rest](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.com/2019/11/13/ovo-and-ovr-classifier/) method it is possible to make binary classifiers multiple.
