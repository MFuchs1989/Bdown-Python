# 1 Introduction

The next unsupervised machine learning cluster algorithms is the Density-Based Spatial Clustering and Application with Noise (DBSCAN).
DBSCAN is a density-based clusering algorithm, which can be used to identify clusters of any shape in a data set containing noise and outliers.



# 2 Loading the libraries


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
