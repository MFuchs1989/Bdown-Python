Now that I have written extensively about the ["PCA"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/07/22/principal-component-analysis-pca/), we now come to another dimension reduction algorithm: The Linear Discriminant Analysis.


For this post the dataset *Wine Quality* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-customer-satisfaction/data) was used. A copy of the record is available at <https://drive.google.com/open?id=11e0pIJeiK0yljlBAlow8mcfH56yfnJYf>.
