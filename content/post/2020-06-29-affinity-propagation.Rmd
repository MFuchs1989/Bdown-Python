# 1 Introduction

In the past few posts some cluster algorithms were presented. 
I wrote extensively about ["k-Means Clustering"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/05/19/k-means-clustering/), ["Hierarchical Clustering"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/06/04/hierarchical-clustering/), ["DBSCAN"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/06/15/dbscan/), ["HDBSCAN"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/06/20/hdbscan/) and finally about ["Gaussian Mixture Models"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/06/24/gaussian-mixture-models/).

Fortunately, we are not yet through with the most common cluster algorithms. So now we come to affinity propagation.

# 2 Loading the libraries


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# For generating some data
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

from sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation
```


# 3 Generating some test data


For the following example, I will generate some sample data.

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=350, centers=4, cluster_std=0.60)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], cmap='viridis')
```

# 4 Introducing Affinity Propagation

Affinity Propagation was published by Frey and Dueck in 2007, and is only getting more and more popular due to its simplicity, general applicability, and performance.





```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
