# 1 Introduction

As already announced in post about ["PCA"](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/2020/07/22/principal-component-analysis-pca/), we now come to the second main application of a PCA: Principal Component Analysis for speed up machine learning models.


For this post the dataset *MNIST* from the statistic platform ["Kaggle"](https://www.kaggle.com) was used. A copy of the record is available at <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Bfquk0uKnh6B3Yjh2N87qh0QcmLokrVk>.



# 2 Loading the libraries and the dataset


```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
```

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
mnist = pd.read_csv('mnist_train.csv')
mnist
```
