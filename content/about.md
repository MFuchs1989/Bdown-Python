['High-dimensional data, meaning data that requires more than two or three dimensions to represent, can be very difficult to interpret. One approach to simplification is to assume that the available data of interest lie on an embedded non-linear manifold within the higher-dimensional space. If the manifold is of low enough dimension, the data can be visualised in the low-dimensional space.'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction)
